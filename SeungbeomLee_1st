\section{Congruent number}

\begin{itemize}
    \item  A congruent number is the number that is the area of right triangle whose sides are all rational numbers. For instance, 6 is congruent number, because there exists right triangle whose sides are 3,4,5.
    \item One of the most important subject in algebra is classifying whether a number n is congruent number. For example, right triangles whose sides are all integers were studied in ancient Greece. Euler showed that n $= 7$ is a congruent number, and Fermat showed that $n = 1$ is not congruent.
    \item But in general, there isn't straight-forward criterion to tell whether given number is congruent. Although there is a simple algorithm using Pythagorean triples $=a^2-b^2$, $Y=2ab$, $Z=a^2 + b^2$ for relatively prime integer a and b, but we don't know time complexity of this algorithm.
    \item We cannot tell n is congruent or not, because we cannot distinguish whether we've waited time not enough to find sufficient number or n isn't really congruent number. For instance, 157 is congruent number, but the simplest rational right triangle's side involves at least 24-digit number. One of the side is $\frac{411340519227716149383203}{21666555693714761309610}$
   \item So people found another way to solve congruent number problems. because elliptic curve has close relationship with congruent number. Later, we can see that $n$ is congruent number if and only if the solution set of elliptic curve $y^2=x^3 - n^2x$ has nonzero rank r, which means that solution set is isomorphic to direct sum of torsion subgroup and finite copies of $\mathbf{Z}$.
 \end{itemize} 
  \section{Elliptic curves}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item  For Pythagorean triple $X<Y<Z$ which has area $n$, we can see that $({X \pm Y\over 2})^2= ({Z \over 2})^2 \pm n$. Multiplying two equations, we can get $({X^2 - Y^2 \over 4})^2 = ({Z \over 2})^4 - n^2$. If we name $u=\frac{Z}{2}$ and $v=\frac{X^2-Y^2}{4}$ and multiplying $u^2$ at each side, then the equation turns into $(uv^2)^2=u^6 - n^2u^2$. If we substitute $u^2$ into $x$ and $uv^2$ into y, then we can see the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - n^2x$.
      \item  So $n$ is congruent number if and only if there is rational solution $(x,y)$ if $x$ satisfies three following conditions.
      \item [(i)] $x$ is square of rational number.
      \item [(ii)] $x$'s denominator is even.
      \item [(iii)] $x$'s numerator has no common factor with $n$.
      \item Therefore, we can substitute congruent number problem into elliptic curve problem, finding rational number solutions.
      \item We want to consider "point at infinity" of $F(x,y)=y^2 - x^3 + n^2x$, because if we consider it, we can think it as a point on the curve, and also points on the complex plane forming Riemann sphere. To do this, we need projective coordinates, and elliptic curve on this plane.
      \item Set $\tilde{F}(x,y,z) = z^kF({x\over z},{y\over z})$, while $k$ is total degree of F. For any nonzero $\lambda$, $\tilde{F}(\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda z)=0$ if and only if $\tilde{F}(x,y,z) =0$. If $z \neq 0$, then it means $F({x\over z},{y\over z})=0$. These two equations have equivalent solution set as $\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{P}_K^3 \} \sim \{(x,y) \in K^2\}$. For point at infinity of $K^2$ is equivalent to $(0,1,0)$.
      \item To understand Elliptic curve, we need to understand elliptic function ${\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z) ={\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z;L) := \frac{1}{z^2} + \sum_{l \in L, l \neq 0} (\frac{1}{(z-l)^2} - \frac{1}{l^2})$, where L is lattice consisted of $\{mw_1 + nw_2, m,n \in \mathbf{Z}\}$. Because this function and its derivative forms field of elliptic functions with lattice L, elliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$ has one-to-one correspondence with the map $z \mapsto ({\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z), {\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z), 1)$ for $z \neq 0$, $0 \mapsto (0,1,0) $ in $\mathbb{C}/L$.
      \section{Elliptic function, and Elliptic curves in Weierstrass form}
      \item Elliptic function $f$ is a meromorphic function on $\mathbf{C} $ such that $f(z+l) = f(z)$ for all$l \in L$, with given lattice $L = \{mw_1 + nw_2, m,n \in \mathbf{Z}\}$, where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are linearly independent at $\mathbf{C}$. Let $\mathcal{E}_L$ be field of elliptic functions in lattice L. 
      \item This set is generated by Weierstrass function ${\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z)$ and its derivative. First, it is element of $\mathcal{E}_L$, and its pole is a double pole at each lattice points.This can be easily proven by calculating its derivative. Also, we can show  $\mathcal{E}_L^+ \subset \mathcal{E}_L$ is generated by ${\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z)$, by listing arbitrary function, $f(z) \in \mathcal{E}_L^+$, 's zeros and poles. 
      \item Moreover, elliptic curve can be described as elliptic function on lattice, since the map $z \mapsto ({\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z), {\boldsymbol{\varphi}}(z), 1)$ for $z \neq 0$, $0 \mapsto (0,1,0) $ in $\mathbb{C}/L$ is analytic and has one-to-one correspondence with $y^2=4x^3-g_2(L)x-g_3(L)$, where $g_2(L)=60\sum_{l \in L, l \neq 0}l^{-4}$, $g_3(L) = 140\sum_{l \in L, l \neq 0}l^{-6}$. So to understand elliptic curve, we should understand field of elliptic function.
